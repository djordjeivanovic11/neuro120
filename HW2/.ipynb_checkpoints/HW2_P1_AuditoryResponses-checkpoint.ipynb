    "# HW 2 Problem 1: Inspecting Auditory Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will investigate data collected in the lab of Christoph Schreiner at UCSF. This data was collected as part of an experiment that probed the impact of early experience on responses in auditory cortex. Seemingly simple manipulations of a young animal's environment can dramatically reshape its neural responses well into adulthood. For example, playing a repetitive pure tone at a single frequency to rat pups can cause their primary auditory cortex to become ∼50% larger, with a huge fraction of neurons selective to the exposure frequency (see [de Villers-Sidani et al., 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17202485/)). This neuroplasticity caused a stir when it was first discovered, both because it speaks to ideas about nature and nurture, and because it has therapeutic implications regarding, for example, restoring hearing through cochlear implants (restoring signals from the peripheral auditory nerve may not be enough if cortical processing has already adapted to the lack of input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will examine is from the following experimental setup: litters of rat pups were reared in a home cage with a speaker above it. The speaker continuously played a specific sound sequence as the young rats were growing up. You can hear the exposure stimulus (the stimulus they listened to while growing up) [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l47YMZSkceV2G-rQVltpDkneQSydqGPb/view?usp=sharing). You will hear that the stimulus consists of a repetitive, chord-like, pulsating sound. The chord is pulsed specifically at 6Hz (6 pulses per second) - we call this the modulation frequency. After this sound exposure period, spiking responses were recorded in primary auditory cortex using silicon electrode probes."
