    "***Example Answer for Problem 2h based on Part II of this assignment***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question:** What is the timecourse of information about grating stimulus orientation contained in the V1 population? For example, how quickly does orientation information become decodable, and how long does it last?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoding Approach:** For each time bin, I would train a logistic regression classifier to decode the stimulus orientation from the population of V1 neurons recorded in this experiment. The input data for each would be an array of spike counts with shape of (n_neuron, n_trials). After calculating accuracy on held-out trials, I would plot accuracy as a function of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome 1: Information remains constantly above chance throughout stimulus duration. \n",
    "If decoding accuracy rose immediately at stimulus onset and remained at peak levels throughout the 500 ms stimulus presentation, returning to chance immediately at offset, this would suggest that V1 maintains equally strong orientation information about stimuli that are physically present in the visual field. An immediate return to chance would reveal that V1 represents only currently present visual information without any persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome 2: Accuracy increases (with a small delay) after stimulus onset, peaks early, then declines but remains above chance. \n",
    "This outcome implies that the most information about orientation is available shortly after the stimulus appears. While some information about orientation remains in the population, the amount is less after that initial transient response. This pattern would suggest that perhaps adaptation mechanisms alter the population activity, and/or that the V1 population is most responsive to changes within the visual field.\n"
